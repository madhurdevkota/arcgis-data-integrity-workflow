# arcgis-data-integrity-workflow
ArcGIS Pro geodatabase automation using Python (`arcpy`). Includes schema creation, subtypes, domains, contingent values, attribute rules, and topology validation to ensure spatial and attribute data integrity. Fully scripted for repeatable, standards-based municipal or infrastructure workflows.



ArcGIS Data Integrity & Validation Workflow

This project demonstrates a complete, reproducible workflow for building a geodatabase in ArcGIS Pro using Python (arcpy)—from raw spatial datasets to a rigorously validated data model. It focuses on ensuring spatial and attribute integrity through structured schema design, domains, subtypes, contingent values, attribute rules, and topology validation.
Key Steps

    Geodatabase & Schema Setup

        Creates a File Geodatabase with multiple feature datasets (Boundaries, Transportation, Education), all defined with consistent spatial references.

        Imports shapefiles and CAD features into their respective datasets.

    Subtypes & Relationship Classes

        Defines subtypes (e.g., residential/commercial lot types) to categorize parcels.

        Establishes composite relationship classes between parcels and building outlines for logical data linkage.

    Domains & Contingent Values

        Creates coded value domains for road attributes such as Accessibility and Seasonality.

        Implements contingent value rules to ensure attribute consistency (e.g., unpaved roads can only be seasonal).

    Attribute Rules & Quality Checks

        Adds validation and constraint rules via Arcade expressions to check engineering tolerances (e.g., pipe wall thickness and operating pressure ranges).

        Enables editor tracking and global IDs to support rule enforcement.

    Topology & Spatial Integrity

        Builds geodatabase topology to enforce spatial rules:

            Buildings must be within parcels.

            Parcels and buildings must not overlap.

        Validates topology and exports any errors for review.

Highlights

    End-to-End Automation – Every step, from importing source data to enforcing integrity constraints, is scripted in arcpy for repeatability.

    Robust QA/QC – Incorporates both attribute-level and spatial-level checks.

    Standards-Based Design – Follows Esri best practices for geodatabase modeling, making it adaptable to municipal, utility, or infrastructure datasets.
